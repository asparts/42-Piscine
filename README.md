What is the Piscine at 42?

The Piscine, French for "swimming pool," is a distinctive four-week intensive selection process employed by 42, a global network of innovative coding schools. This immersive program allows prospective students to dive into the fundamentals of programming, regardless of prior coding experience. Participants engage in daily coding exercises, individual and group projects, and peer evaluations, all designed to mirror 42's unique peer-to-peer learning methodology. 


Throughout the Piscine, candidates are encouraged to seek concrete solutions to problems, fostering self-reliance and collaborative learning. This approach emphasizes practical problem-solving over rote memorization, with mistakes viewed as valuable learning opportunities rather than failures. 


The Piscine serves as both a rigorous assessment and an introduction to 42's educational environment, helping candidates determine if the school's innovative methods align with their learning styles. It's a demanding yet rewarding experience that has become a hallmark of 42's admissions process.
