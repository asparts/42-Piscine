# 🌊 What is the Piscine at 42?

**The Piscine** (French for “swimming pool”) is an intensive **four-week coding bootcamp** and selection process used by [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/), a global network of innovative coding schools. It’s designed to immerse participants—regardless of experience level—into the core principles of programming through hands-on learning and peer collaboration.

## 💡 What Makes the Piscine Unique?

- 🧠 **No prior coding experience required** – just curiosity and persistence  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Peer-to-peer learning** – no traditional teachers or lectures  
- 🔁 **Daily projects & evaluations** – code, submit, review, repeat  
- 🧰 **Real-world problem-solving** – learn by doing, failing, and trying again

---

## 🚀 How It Works

During the Piscine, participants:
- Tackle daily exercises and coding challenges
- Collaborate on group projects
- Evaluate and learn from each other's work
- Practice autonomy, time management, and adaptability

This environment encourages:
- 🤝 Collaboration over competition  
- 🧩 Practical skills over memorization  
- 🛠️ Iterative improvement through feedback and failure

## 🎯 Purpose

The Piscine is both:
- A **selection phase** for candidates applying to 42
- An **introductory experience** into 42's unconventional, self-directed education model

It’s **intense**, **demanding**, and **deeply rewarding**—ideal for those ready to dive headfirst into the world of code.
